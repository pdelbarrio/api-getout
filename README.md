# GET OUT API

This is the backend of Get Out, an app that is a collaborative database of cool places in the city. Users will be able to register to add sites to favorites and will be able to register new sites that will be added to the database (after moderation) so that other users can discover those sites.

This backend is being made with Express and TDD with Jest.

This Readme file is being constantly updated.
